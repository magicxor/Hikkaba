An update is now live on Steam containing over 90 changes since last week’s build! This includes level design and gameplay tweaks, and core changes to the way levels are loaded and unloaded.

I finished off integrating Lyall’s work on the office, which includes a completely revamped Arque foyer and brand new underground areas. I’d recommend everyone to experience this – if you’re only interested in the new parts, play from map 6 onwards.

<h1>Outdoor Lighting Tweaks</h1>

The outdoors of the office area is now far brighter, with lots of indirect and direct moonlight pouring in from the night sky.

<h1>Streaming Overhaul</h1>

To support the office changes, I overhauled the level streaming system for Act II. Previously, levels were streamed in and out based on whether you were inside a large, invisible box. This worked well when levels were quite sparse, however does not work when they’re close together.

This change means that walking through certain doorways, and performing certain actions makes levels load in, creating a smoother playing experience.

<h1>Physics Tweaks</h1>

The physics for held actors should now feel a lot less floaty. In addition, throwing items now adds some angular velocity to them, so they don’t spin vertically when tossed.

<h1>Explosive Barrels</h1>

Explosive barrels are now a gameplay mechanic in Act II! You’ll spot them in the new office content, and in future Act II levels.

<h1>Loading Screen</h1>

Act II now features an initial loading screen with a bar reflecting the load progress - though you will only see this once when you start the game up.

<h1>Italian Translations</h1>

Estranged: Act II is now translated to Italian, with a big thanks to the community contributor Anna C. If you’d like to translate Estranged: Act II to your language, feel free to reach out to alan [at] alanedwardes (dot) com.
