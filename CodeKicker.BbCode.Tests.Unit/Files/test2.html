I am currently taking a summer break which has meant I haven’t been able to work on Estranged a whole bunch over the past couple of weeks, but updates will resume their regularity soon.

<h1>Detailing</h1>

The office, the sewer level and the earlier pool level have all received detailing updates, along with some updates to the first outdoor level to prevent players from getting stuck.

The levels in general are getting brighter, which has been a point of pain for some players.

<h1>Elevator Changes</h1>

The elevator on the pool level has been tweaked - now instead of using the in-game physics engine, it uses triggered logic to count the number of props added to the elevator.

Once the mass reaches a certain level, the elevator drops down as before – however using an animation sequence, rather than a physically driven simulation.

This provides greater control over this sequence, and means that it behaves the same for every player.

<h1>Spanish Translations</h1>

The game is now localised to Spanish thanks for a contribution by Rafael P.H. This brings the list of supported languages in Estranged: Act II to Bulgarian, German, Spanish (Spain), French, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian and Slovak. Thank you to all of the people that have contributed their translations to the project!

If you’d like to translate Estranged to your language, drop me an email at alan [at] alanedwardes (dot) com. The translation sources are public and can be found on BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/estranged/insulam.localization/src

Thanks for playing! If you have any feedback, let me know directly, or use the in-game feedback, the forums or Steam reviews.
